Hello!  Thank you for your interest in Franklin Barbecue.

We are all full for JULY
 
 We are not yet
taking orders for Aug-Dec.
*August ordering will be taken on July 15th.
As always, please remember to give us several dates you are interested in.

(Weekends fill up first).
The more flexible you are with your dates, the better chance we will be able accommodate your request.
Hopefully…we will be able to transition from email ordering to
ordering directly from our website by August 4th.
(That will be for September).


If it is a weekend date that you are interested in, those fill up extra fast.
Feel free to email several dates you would be interested in.
(Folks start ordering at midnight, we do not accept orders that are sent in before
midnight).

Pre-ordering information.


We accept orders on either whole briskets, whole pork butts, or whole racks of ribs. These will be whole and unsliced.
We also accept orders for meat by the pound, with a minimum of 5 pounds total. These will be sliced.
We are unable to wrap different increments of meat separately.
(example of an acceptable order: 3 pounds brisket, 2 pounds ribs, pint potato salad.)
Sides may be added in pints, quarts, or trays (25.00).
In order to skip the line, preorders may only be picked up between 10:00 am and 10:3am.
If you are unable to come during this time, you must wait in line. We are unable to make exceptions.
No plates and no sandwiches. To go only.
Cost- Whole briskets generally weigh 5-8 pounds, racks of ribs are generally 2.5 pounds, pork butts are generally 5-6 pounds.

Here is the full restaurant menu, which includes current pricing for meats by the lb. –http://www.franklinbarbecue.com//menu
Don’t know how much to order? We suggest at least 1/2 pound of meat (total)/person. Healthy eaters will eat much more
 Thank you very much!
